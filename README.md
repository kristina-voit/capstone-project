# VitaMed - because your health matters!

Welcome to my capstone-project!

This app helps to keep track of medical matters such as medication, upcoming doctor's appointments, or the logging of emotional state and symptoms in hectic everyday life.

All current information is summarized briefly in the dashboard, and in detail on the following menu pages. 


On the Mood & Symptoms page, you can keep a kind of diary with predefined mood emojis, a date entry and a free field for notes. 

The medications page contains detailed information on the medications currently being taken, new medications can be created and an interaction check with the existing medications can be performed. 

In the appointments section, there is information on upcoming doctor's appointments, as well as the option to click directly to the doctor's website, call him or write an email with a predefined subject line, so that the user can be directly assigned to the doctor. There is also a redirect to an overview of doctors, in case one is looking for a new doctor. 

And last but not least, if you are in an acute stress situation, the last menu item contains a guided breathing exercise to help you relax and focus.
